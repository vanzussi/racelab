# How do you Train Robot Racers?

You train their brains to learn by setting up rewards or punishments for the things the racers do

For example you can give them a reward for going faster, making progress around a track, or a punishment for bumping into walls

Or maybe you want them to bump into the walls... and go backwards...

You change their settings, positive values for rewards and negative values for punishments 

The racers will try out all types of driving and slowly they'll learn and keep doing the things that get them the highest scores

I've never got the hang of it, which is why I need you to experiment and train the best racer
