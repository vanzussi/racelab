# Robot Racing Online Championship

In my future, the planet became inhospitable when global warming spiraled out of control, humans were unable to survive. 

A few washing machines, toasters and kettles survived and we preserved some aspects of humanity in the form of Robot Racers

The Teafel kettles set up the Robot Race leagues, with your help hopefully we can enter them someday
